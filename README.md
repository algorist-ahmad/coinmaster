# CoinMaster

## 2025-04-04

Branch master is unmaintained and the schema is too complicated. Decided to use a real finance tool
like GNUCash or Firefly III instead, and have coinmaster's responsability limited to simple bill deadlines
management and reminding.

Full financial responsability will be passed to wife instead, I only have to worry about paying my
bills on time and ensure that I'm not going into debt (Income vs expense).

### TODO

- [ ] `--help` option
- [x] Add style to help.txt similarly to github.com/algorist-ahmad/parse/help.txt
- [ ] Listing and persisting bills (use taskwarrior)
- [ ] Must be able to answer the questions such as: 'am I going into debt?' or 'can I afford it this week?'
- [ ] Must be able to create tasks and add them to my task database
